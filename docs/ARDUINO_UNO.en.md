# Arduino Uno

This document describes the support for the classic Arduino Uno (ATmega328P).

## Overview
The Arduino Uno is the reference platform for the Arduino ecosystem.

## Configuration
Due to the 8-bit architecture and limited resources, the HAL implementation for the AVR architecture may be less performant than on 32-bit ARM platforms. It serves as a baseline for compatibility.
